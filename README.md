## How to use:
* Download the project or import the 5 scripts into your own project.
* Add the MapGenerator2D into a GameObject (Recommended an empty GameObject).
* Reference the plane with texture you want to be changed into the MapDisplay script that had been added with the MapGenerator2D.
* Have fun modifying the setting and seen what cool looking terrain you can create.
